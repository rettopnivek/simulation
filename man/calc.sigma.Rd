\title{Calculations for Variance Terms for Linear Regression}
\usage{
calc.sigma(inputs, type = "residual")
}
\arguments{
\item{inputs}{Either...
\itemize{
\item A vector with the coefficient for the predictor,
the variance of the predictor, and the desired
R-squared value.
\item A list with the vector of coefficients, the
covariance matrix for the predictors, and
the desired R-squared value.
\item A vector with the total number of observations,
the variance for the outcome, the
variance for the given predictor,
and the R-squared value.
}}

\item{type}{A character string, either...
\itemize{
\item \code{'residual'} (compute standard deviation for
the residuals and outcome).
\item \code{'SE'} (compute the standard error for a
regression coefficient).
}}
}
\value{
A vector of values.
}
\description{
Assorted calculations for variance terms in the
standard linear regression model (i.e., the
residual standard deviation, the standard error
for coefficients, etc.).

\examples{

# Given a correlation of .5 and standardized
# scores compute residual SD
calc.sigma( c( beta = .5, var_x = 1, R2 = sqrt(.5) ), 'residual' )
calc.sigma( c( n = 30, var_y = 1, var_x = 1, R2 = .1 ), 'SE' )

# Multiple correlated predictors

# Create covariance matrix
Sigma <- matrix.corr( c( .2, .2, .4 ), 'initialize' )

# Compute standard deviation for residuals and outcome
calc.sigma(
  list( beta = c( .2, -.3, .25 ), Sigma = Sigma, R2 = .35 ), 'residual'
)
